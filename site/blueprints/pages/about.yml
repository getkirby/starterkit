# We use tabs here to focus on the layout in one tab
# and have the additional contact fields in a secondary
# tab. Tabs can really help to clean up the interface
# when it otherwise gets too complicated
tabs:
  content:
    icon: text
    label: Content
    fields:
      layout:
        label: Layout
        type: layout
        layouts:
          - "1/1"
          - "1/2, 1/2"
          - "1/3, 1/3, 1/3"
  # The contact tab pre-defines a set of address
  # fields for the contact box at the bottom of the about
  # page. Combining modular content from layouts with
  # pre-defined content from such fields is a great way to
  # offer flexibility and yet keep certain constraints.
  #
  # The form layout is created with two columns,
  # each column has a set of fields
