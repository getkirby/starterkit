**Kirby: the CMS that adapts to any project, loved by developers and editors alike.**
The Starterkit is a full-blown Kirby installation with a lot of example content, blueprints, templates and more.
It is ideal for new users to explore many of Kirby's options and get to know the Panel.

You can learn more about Kirby at [getkirby.com](https://getkirby.com).

### Try Kirby for free

You can try Kirby and the Starterkit on your local machine or on a test server as long as you need to make sure it is the right tool for your next project. … and when you’re convinced, [buy your license](https://getkirby.com/buy).

The Starterkit is a demo of basic Kirby features. It's not recommended to be used "as is" in production. Please, follow our documentation closely for more features and guides on how to build secure, high-quality websites with Kirby.

While Kirby as the CMS software itself requires you to purchase a license, we consider the files primarily connected to this Starterkit (assets, templates, snippets...) free to use under the MIT license. Feel free to start building your own project with them.
